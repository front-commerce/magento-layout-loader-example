This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

It is a running example of how [magento-layout-loader](https://github.com/magento-research/pwa-buildpack/blob/a5517415d6a571aa92bde32ead3f232f7186e833/docs/magento-layout-loader.md) works.

## Current implementation

Implementation is available at :

* `config/webpack.config.dev.js` when using the loader
* `App.js`

## Installation

Make sure to have node 8 running. Then run the following commands.

```
npm install
```

## Running the app

```
npm start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view launched web app it in the browser. Then you can compare the DOM with what's actually in `src/App.js`.
